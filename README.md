# gem_downman
python-based command line version of Owen Rudge's https://www.owenrudge.net/GEM/downman that's compatible with the original downlist.txt file

# What do different text files do?
"url.txt" - URLs where it'll look to find the file list, in order of searching.

"FileList - Old.txt" - the original download list at "https://www.owenrudge.net/GEM/downlist.txt". horribly out of date.
"FileList - Old+Ren.txt" - "FileList - Old.txt" but all URLs have been pointed at the closest still-up site. (except http://www.cableone.net/eathan/ )
"FileList - Add.txt" - "FileList - Old+Ren.txt" with a few extra files at the bottom.
